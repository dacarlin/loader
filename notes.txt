A music loader for the MP3 player 

Main thing is to load albums on to the player so that they play
in order. As far as I know, that will have to be done with the 
file names. So the back end is 

- given a list of folders with numbered files in them 
- write all the names as a flat list preserving order
- but who cares what order the albums are in 

This enables me to skip through albums on the player. Set a limit 
of 10 albums, or maybe 8 albums. 

The front end is you have to nominate a number of albums, which 
means some selector interface. I wonder if a Python TUI is too 
slow for this
